a. Create a repository name: git_assignment_HeroVired

APAC+njalkote@TIBCO-PG030Z1L MINGW64 ~/Documents/Assignment2-git
$ git init git_assignment_HeroVired
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/njalkote/Documents/Assignment2-git/git_assignment_HeroVired/.git/

b. Create a ‘dev’ branch and add this code.

APAC+njalkote@TIBCO-PG030Z1L MINGW64 ~/Documents/Assignment2-git/git_assignment_HeroVired (master)
$ git checkout -b dev
Switched to a new branch 'dev'

APAC+njalkote@TIBCO-PG030Z1L MINGW64 ~/Documents/Assignment2-git/git_assignment_HeroVired (feature/sqrt)
$ touch calculator.py

APAC+njalkote@TIBCO-PG030Z1L MINGW64 ~/Documents/Assignment2-git/git_assignment_HeroVired (feature/sqrt)
$ vi calculator.py


c. Merge this branch with the main branch and make a release of version 1 of the ‘calculator plus app’.

APAC+njalkote@TIBCO-PG030Z1L MINGW64 ~/Documents/Assignment2-git/git_assignment_HeroVired (feature/sqrt)
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'

APAC+njalkote@TIBCO-PG030Z1L MINGW64 ~/Documents/Assignment2-git/git_assignment_HeroVired (master)
$ git merge dev
Already up to date.

APAC+njalkote@TIBCO-PG030Z1L MINGW64 ~/Documents/Assignment2-git/git_assignment_HeroVired (master)
$ git tag -a V1 -m "release of V1"

APAC+njalkote@TIBCO-PG030Z1L MINGW64 ~/Documents/Assignment2-git/git_assignment_HeroVired (master)
$ git push origin master --tags
fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

APAC+njalkote@TIBCO-PG030Z1L MINGW64 ~/Documents/Assignment2-git/git_assignment_HeroVired (master)
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/nikitajalkote/git_assignment_HeroVired.git

e. Implement a feature by creating a new branch called ‘feature/sqrt’. f. Add the ‘sqrt’ code to it.

APAC+njalkote@TIBCO-PG030Z1L MINGW64 ~/Documents/Assignment2-git/git_assignment_HeroVired (master)
$ git checkout -b feature/sqrt
fatal: a branch named 'feature/sqrt' already exists


APAC+njalkote@TIBCO-PG030Z1L MINGW64 ~/Documents/Assignment2-git/git_assignment_HeroVired (feature/sqrt)
$ git merge dev
Already up to date.

g. While you are working on this feature, imagine that one critical bug is reported in the main branch, and you need to switch back to the ‘dev’ branch, create fixes, and apply them while keeping your ‘feature/sqrt’ branch up-to-date. For this, you need to create

The bug fixation is in the divide function and the new function should be: def divide(self, a, b):

if b == 0:

raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero.")

return a / b

APAC+njalkote@TIBCO-PG030Z1L MINGW64 ~/Documents/Assignment2-git/git_assignment_HeroVired (dev)
$ vi calculator.py

h. After completing the feature implementation and ensuring that the application works correctly, create a pull request targeting the main branch.

APAC+njalkote@TIBCO-PG030Z1L MINGW64 ~/Documents/Assignment2-git/git_assignment_HeroVired (dev)
$ git checkout feature/sqrt
Switched to branch 'feature/sqrt'

APAC+njalkote@TIBCO-PG030Z1L MINGW64 ~/Documents/Assignment2-git/git_assignment_HeroVired (feature/sqrt)
$ git merge dev

fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly

j. Once the code reviewer approves your pull request, merge the "feature/sqrt" branch into the ‘dev’ branch.
APAC+njalkote@TIBCO-PG030Z1L MINGW64 ~/Documents/Assignment2-git/git_assignment_HeroVired (feature/sqrt)
$ git checkout dev
Switched to branch 'dev'

APAC+njalkote@TIBCO-PG030Z1L MINGW64 ~/Documents/Assignment2-git/git_assignment_HeroVired (dev)
$ git merge feature/sqrt
Already up to date.

APAC+njalkote@TIBCO-PG030Z1L MINGW64 ~/Documents/Assignment2-git/git_assignment_HeroVired (dev)
$ git push origin dev
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
client_loop: send disconnect: Connection reset by peer
send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly

k. Finally, do the testing in the ‘dev’ branch itself and merge it into the ‘main’ branch and create a ‘version 2’ release.

APAC+njalkote@TIBCO-PG030Z1L MINGW64 ~/Documents/Assignment2-git/git_assignment_HeroVired (dev)
$ git checkout dev
